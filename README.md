GROMACS for GROMACS files, VASP for VASP files.

TrajCenter is some quick code to center the trajectory in the PBC and then write to file. It writes to a centered TRR, selects a frame to use for a starting point PDB for VASP, and then converts that PDB to a POSCAR file. Code isn't cleaned up at all. Just use as an example.
